# What is Variable
  **Variable** is named storage used to hold data that can be change later during program execution. think variable as container which is used to store data like number, string and 
  object. with the help of variable we can create dynamic programs which is used to store, modify and retrieve the data.

# Types of variables in Javascript.
  In Javascript there are three different types to create variables `var`, `let` and `const`. <br>
  1. **`var` (Variable Declaration)**
     - **Scope**: `var` keyword has **function scope**. This means variable declared with `var` keyword are accesible throughout the function that declared in or globally if not in                         function
     - **Hoisting** : `var` keyword hoisted top of their scope. this means variable moves to the top of their scope but not initialized.
     - **Re-declaration**: variable declared with `var` keyword can be redeclared within same scope.
       ```javascript
           var x = 5;
           var x = 10; // No error, x is now 10

       ```

  2. **`let` (Block Scope)**
     - **Scope**: `let` keyword has block scope. This means variable declared with `let` keyword are accesible within the block they are declared.
     - **Hoisting**: `let` keyword hoisted top of their scope but not initialized. This means accesing the variable before declaration will give reference error.
     - **Re-declaration**: variable declared with `let` keyword cannot be re-declared within same scope.
     - **Example**
       ```javascript
           let y = 5;
           y = 10; // Allowed, y is now 10
           let y = 15; // Error: Identifier 'y' has already been declared

       ```
  3. **`const` (constant Variable)**
     - **Scope**: `const` keyword has block scope. This means variable declared with `const` keyword are accesible within the block they are declared.
     - **Hoisting**: `const` keyword hoisted top of their scope but not initialized. This means accesing the variable before declaration will give reference error.
     - **Re-declaration and Re-assignment**: variable declared with `const` keyword cannot be re-declared or re-assigned after initial assignment. however for the `objects` and for the        `arrays` content still be modified.
     - **Example**
      ```javascript
           const z = 5;
           z = 10; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
           const obj = { key: "value" };
           obj.key = "newValue"; // Allowed, modifying the object property
       ```
# Scope in Javscript
  1. **Global Scope**: any variable declared outside function or block has global scope. This means that variable are accesible anywhere in code.
  2. **Function Scope**: varibale declared with `var` keyword inside function has function scope. This means that variable is accesible in only that function.
  3. **Block Scope**: variable declared using `let` and `const` keyword in block `{}` has block scope. This means variable is accesible within only that block.

# Hoisting
  Hoisting is default behaviour of javascript to move the declaration top of their scope. `var` keyword is hoisted and initialized with `undefined`. `let` and `const` keyword hoisted     but not initialized. 

# Shadowing
  The variable can be `shadowed` if variable with same name declared in different scope. if variable declared in inner block (close to execution context) will shadow the variable      
  declared in outer block.

# Best practices
  - use `const` and `let` keyword to avoid scope and hoisting issue.
  - use `const` keyword if value is not gonna change and `let` if value gonna change.
  - use meaningful variable name to enhace code readability.
  - follow consistent naming convention, like camelCase

# Pseudocode for Using Variables

  ```javascript
      // Declare a global variable using var
      var globalVar = "I'm global";

      // Function to demonstrate function-scoped variable
      function demonstrateVar() {
        var functionScopedVar = "I'm function-scoped"; 
        console.log(functionScopedVar); // Outputs: I'm function-scoped
      }

      // Block to demonstrate block-scoped variables
      if (condition) {
        let blockScopedLet = "I'm block-scoped";
        const blockScopedConst = "I'm also block-scoped";
    
        console.log(blockScopedLet); // Outputs: I'm block-scoped
        console.log(blockScopedConst); // Outputs: I'm also block-scoped
      }

      // Hoisting example
      console.log(hoistedVar); // Outputs: undefined
      var hoistedVar = "I'm hoisted";

      // Trying to access block-scoped variable outside the block
      console.log(blockScopedLet); // Error: blockScopedLet is not defined
  ```

# Data Types
  1. **Primitive Data Types** <br>
     Primitive data types are the most basic data type and represents single value. They are immutable in nature, means once value is assigned it can't be changed.
     Primitive Data Types has following sub types;
     1. **Number**: Number represents both integer and floating point numbers. example, `42` and `3.14` Javascript doesn't distinguish between Integer and Floating-Point numbers they           both treated as Number.
     2. **String**: Strings are the sequence of characters. Strings are used to store text and are enclosed in single quotes `''`, double quotes `""` or backticks ``. example `"Hello"`
     3. **Boolean**: Boolean represent logical entity value `true` or `false`.
     4. **Undefined**: when variable is declared without initialiaztion it's automically assigned `undefined` value.
     5. **Null**: Null is intentional absence of value. it is explicitly assigned to indicate that varibale has no value.
     6. **Symbol**: Symbol is unique and immutable value. it is oftnely used as object property keys to avoid same property name collision. example, `Symbol('unique')`.
     7. **bigInt**: Represents integers with arbitrary precision, useful for handling very large integers. Example: `1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n`.
    
     **Notes** <br>
     1. **Type Coercion With `null` and `undefined`** <br>
       - using `undefined` with number result is in `NaN` value. example 5+`undefined` will return `NaN`.
       - `null` is treated as `0` in arithmetic operation. example 5+`null` will return `5`.
     2. **BigInt and Number Interaction**: <br>
       - `BigInt` cannot be directly mixed with `number` in arithmetic operation. `5n + 1` is valid but will throw `TypeError`.
     3. **String Conversion** <br>
       - when concatenating `number` and `string`, The `number` is converted to `string` example `5 + '5'` will return `55`.
     4. **Symbol Uniqueness** <br>
       - Symbols are unique and can't be replicated. Even if we create symbol with same description it will not be equal to original symbol.

  2. **Non-Primitive Data Types** <br>
     Non-Primitive data types are mutable in nature. strored as reference. operations can change original value.

     1. **Objects** <br>
        In Javascript, object is a collection of properties, where each property is key-value pair. object can hold multiple data types, including function and other objects.
        - Creating an Object
          ```javascript

             const person = {
             name: 'Alice',
             age: 30,
             greet() {
               return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
             }
            };

          ```
        - Accessing and Modifying Object
          ```javascript
            console.log(person.name); // Alice
            person.age = 31;
            console.log(person['age']); // 31

          ```

        - Adding New Properties
          ```javascript
             person.job = 'Engineer';
          ```

        - Deleting Properties
          ```javascript
             delete person.job;
          ```
     2. **Built In Objects** <br>
        Javascript provides several built in projects as following:

        - **Object**: The base object from which all objects inherit. <br>
          ```javascript
             const obj = new Object();
          ```
        - **Array**: For storing ordered collections.
          ```javascript
             const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
          ```
        - **String**: For manipulating text.
          ```javascript
            const str = 'Hello';
          ```
        - **Number**: For Numeric Operations.
          ```javascript
             const num = 123;
          ```
        - **Boolean**: For logical values.
          ```javascript
             const flag = true;
          ```
        - **Date**: For working with dates and times.
          ```javascript
             const date = new Date();
          ```
        - **RegExp**: for pattern matching in string.
          ```javascript
             const pattern = /ab+c/;
          ```
        - **Error**: For handling errors.
          ```javascript
             const error = new Error('Something went wrong');
          ```
     3. **Prototypal Inheritance** <br>
        Prototypal Inheritance allows objects to innherit properties from other objects. every object has prototype from which it inherits methods and properties.
        - Prototype Chain:
          Every object in JavaScript has a prototype. When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks at the object itself. If it doesnâ€™t find the property,            it looks up the prototype chain, starting from the object's prototype and continuing up the chain until it reaches Object.prototype (which is the end of the chain).


          ```javascript
             function Animal(name) {
               this.name = name;
             }

             Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
                  console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
             };

             const dog = new Animal('Rex');
             dog.speak(); // Rex makes a noise.
          ```
        - Inheriting from Prototypes:
          ```javascript
             function Dog(name, breed) {
                Animal.call(this, name);
                this.breed = breed;
             }

             Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
             Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

             Dog.prototype.bark = function() {
                console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
             };

             const myDog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Golden Retriever');
             myDog.speak(); // Buddy makes a noise.
             myDog.bark(); // Buddy barks.

          ```
      4. **Object Prototype** <br>
         Prototype of an object is another object from which it inherits properties. this allows to create shared properties and methods.
         - Accessing Prototype
           ```javascript
              const obj = {};
              console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)); // Logs the prototype of obj
           ```
           
         - **Setting Prototype**
           ```javascript
              const proto = { greet: 'Hello' };
              const obj = Object.create(proto);
              console.log(obj.greet); // Hello
           ```
         - **Prototype Property**
           ```javascript
              function Person(name) {
                 this.name = name;
              }

              Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
                return `Hello, ${this.name}`;
              };

              const person = new Person('Alice');
              console.log(person.sayHello()); // Hello, Alice

           ```
