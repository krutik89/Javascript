# What is Variable
  **Variable** is named storage used to hold data that can be change later during program execution. think variable as container which is used to store data like number, string and 
  object. with the help of variable we can create dynamic programs which is used to store, modify and retrieve the data.

# Types of variables in Javascript.
  In Javascript there are three different types to create variables `var`, `let` and `const`. <br>
  1. **`var` (Variable Declaration)**
     - **Scope**: `var` keyword has **function scope**. This means variable declared with `var` keyword are accesible throughout the function that declared in or globally if not in                         function
     - **Hoisting** : `var` keyword hoisted top of their scope. this means variable moves to the top of their scope but not initialized.
     - **Re-declaration**: variable declared with `var` keyword can be redeclared within same scope.
       ```javascript
           var x = 5;
           var x = 10; // No error, x is now 10

       ```

  2. **`let` (Block Scope)**
     - **Scope**: `let` keyword has block scope. This means variable declared with `let` keyword are accesible within the block they are declared.
     - **Hoisting**: `let` keyword hoisted top of their scope but not initialized. This means accesing the variable before declaration will give reference error.
     - **Re-declaration**: variable declared with `let` keyword cannot be re-declared within same scope.
     - **Example**
       ```javascript
           let y = 5;
           y = 10; // Allowed, y is now 10
           let y = 15; // Error: Identifier 'y' has already been declared

       ```
  3. **`const` (constant Variable)**
     - **Scope**: `const` keyword has block scope. This means variable declared with `const` keyword are accesible within the block they are declared.
     - **Hoisting**: `const` keyword hoisted top of their scope but not initialized. This means accesing the variable before declaration will give reference error.
     - **Re-declaration and Re-assignment**: variable declared with `const` keyword cannot be re-declared or re-assigned after initial assignment. however for the `objects` and for the        `arrays` content still be modified.
     - **Example**
      ```javascript
           const z = 5;
           z = 10; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
           const obj = { key: "value" };
           obj.key = "newValue"; // Allowed, modifying the object property
       ```
# Scope in Javscript
  1. **Global Scope**: any variable declared outside function or block has global scope. This means that variable are accesible anywhere in code.
  2. **Function Scope**: varibale declared with `var` keyword inside function has function scope. This means that variable is accesible in only that function.
  3. **Block Scope**: variable declared using `let` and `const` keyword in block `{}` has block scope. This means variable is accesible within only that block.

# Hoisting
  Hoisting is default behaviour of javascript to move the declaration top of their scope. `var` keyword is hoisted and initialized with `undefined`. `let` and `const` keyword hoisted     but not initialized. 

# Shadowing
  The variable can be `shadowed` if variable with same name declared in different scope. if variable declared in inner block (close to execution context) will shadow the variable      
  declared in outer block.

# Best practices
  - use `const` and `let` keyword to avoid scope and hoisting issue.
  - use `const` keyword if value is not gonna change and `let` if value gonna change.
  - use meaningful variable name to enhace code readability.
  - follow consistent naming convention, like camelCase
